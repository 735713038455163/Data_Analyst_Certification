# School_District_Analysis
 
### Leslie Debassige UofT Bootcamp
# Module 4 School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
During the fifth week of the Trilogy University of Toronto Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp our forth challenge is to create a written analysis with three key deliverables as follows; 
*Deliverable 1: Replace ninth-grade reading and math scores
*Deliverable 2: Repeat the school district analysis
*Deliverable 3: A written report for the school district analysis (README.md)


The tools that will be used are Python in order to do the following:

* Create scripts that read, write, and store data from files or in arrays.
* Perform mathematical operations.
* Use decision statements, logical operations for complex comparisons, and repetition statements to run code more than once.
* Produce screen outputs.

 The data that we will be using is the PyPoll solution python script, the election results .csv, and the election_results.txt. to help Seth and Toms become familiar with the command line, which will be used to make updates to the GitHub repository, access local files and folders, and write and run Python programming scripts. 

## Purpose
We will be using Python to write algorithms that will assist the confirmation and analysis of election results.

## Analysis and Challenges

We will be using Python to write algorithms that will assist the confirmation and analysis of election results. 

## Results


When the file to load is successful you have an understanding how to change directory by using cd and linking a copy of the file path to ensure the code refers to the relative directory versus the absolute. 
As such:

![filetoloadsuccessful](https://github.com/735713038455163/Election-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/filetoloadsuccess.PNG)


## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Debugging code and troubleshooting is a difficult but rewarding task in the field of data science. 

Such as this error:

![error](https://github.com/735713038455163/Election-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/error.PNG)

The error is an IOError, which is an "Input/Output" error, meaning that we used an output directory, 'analysis/election_analysis.txt', that doesn't exist with the given file path.
